Project to determine the Best PGA player from 2010 to 2018 In this notebook, we're going to create a machine learning model that predicts which player on the PGA tour is the best, utilizing criteria from Kaggle's PGA tour data.
1. Problem definition:
How well can we predict the best player on the PGA tour, given their characteristics and previous examples of wins and top 10 finishes.

2. Data:
The data is downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/jmpark746/pga-tour-data-2010-2018

3. Evaluation:
The evaluation metric will be determined by accuracy for predcicting which player obtains the most wins and top 10 finishes using the available criteria.

4. Features:
Kaggle provides a data list of 18 columns for evaulation (see the link above)
